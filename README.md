## Step 1

Step 1 incorporates multiple basemaps and plotting of earthquake data from USGS. Circles are sized and colored by the magnitude of the earthquake, and colors are derived using a d3 color interpolation scheme.

## Step 2

Step 2 builds upon Step 1 by incorporating a satellite basemap and adding a fault-line layer sourced from a geojson file.

**Note**: For both steps, the config.js file referenced in index.html has not been included for security reasons. If you wish to run either step, you must supply a config.js file with a mapbox API key.
